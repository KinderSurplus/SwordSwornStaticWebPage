Welcome to my static website readme

This website shows off my capabilities of front-end web development using languages such as HTML and CSS.
It talks about a fictional videogame called Sword Sworn.
All graphics, styling, and HTML was created by me (Kinda Wassouf).

To check out the site, please double click on the Home.html file. It should then open up automatically
in your main browser. If not, right click the file, hover over "open with", and choose your browser
in the dropdown list.

Thanks for checking it out!
